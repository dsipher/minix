tahoe/64 as a whole, in particular the system compiler and kernel,
is original work. much of the userland, however, including large
portions of the standard library, has been cobbled together from
`old' sources with BSD-compatible licenses of various flavors. to
avoid clutter, i have stripped the boilerplate often found in the
sources; instead, i have tried to honor the spirit of the license,
giving credit where credit is due, with a single-line attribution
in each derived source file. it should be assumed that the original
license was `something BSDish' as below. we have been pointlessly
polluting sources with this nonsense for decades now. it must end.

(adopted projects which are large enough to have their own directories
in the source tree will retain their license files, if they have any.)

if any of the original copyright holders object to this consolidation,
just let me know. i will be happy to remove the affected sources. -- cey
