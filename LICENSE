tahoe/64 as a whole, in particular the system compiler and kernel,
is original work. much of the userland, however, including large
portions of the standard library, has been cobbled together from
`old' sources with BSD-compatible licenses of various flavors. i
have tried to honor the spirit if not the letter of such licenses
(`credit where credit is due, and there is no warranty') while 
also avoiding the pointless copying of legal text that we've been 
doing with BSD licenses for 30+ years. to that end, each derived
source file carries a simple attribution; the license for all such
sources should be assumed to be `something BSDish' as below. -- cey
