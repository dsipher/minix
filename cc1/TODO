==== unify signed and unsigned integral comparisons  =========================

    (a) classify condition codes according to whether
        they can be combined in a single block or not
    (b) change logic in bypass_succ() to consult the
        above classes when deciding to bypass or not
    (c) extend fold.c to evaluate both signed
        and unsigned results simultaneously
    (d) extend OPT_LIR_CMP to eliminate duplicate
        comparisons of types that are simpatico

    EXAMPLE: _add_reg in reg.s currently reads

        L293:
                movq 8(%r13),%rax
                movl (%rax,%r12,4),%eax
                cmpl %eax,%ebx
                jz L291
        L298:
                cmpl %eax,%ebx
                jb L295

    the second comparison is not only unnecessary
    but impedes further optimization of the loop.

==== avoid division insns when dividend is constant  =========================

    per "Division by Invariant Integers using Multiplication",
                                Granlund and Montgomery (1994).

    EXAMPLE: _numxwidth in ls.s currently reads:

                ...
        L494:
                incl %esi
                movl $10,%ecx
                xorl %edx,%edx
                divq %rcx

                ...

    this division by 10 is better done by the methods of the above paper.
