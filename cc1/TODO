==== unify signed and unsigned integral comparisons  =========================

    (a) classify condition codes according to whether
        they can be combined in a single block or not
    (b) change logic in bypass_succ() to consult the
        above classes when deciding to bypass or not
    (c) extend fold.c to evaluate both signed
        and unsigned results simultaneously
    (d) extend OPT_LIR_CMP to eliminate duplicate
        comparisons of types that are simpatico

    EXAMPLE: _add_reg in reg.s currently reads

        L293:
                movq 8(%r13),%rax
                movl (%rax,%r12,4),%eax
                cmpl %eax,%ebx
                jz L291
        L298:
                cmpl %eax,%ebx
                jb L295

    the second comparison is not only unnecessary
    but impedes further optimization of the loop.
