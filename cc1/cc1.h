/* MAX_TYPE_BITS and MAX_ALIGN_BITS give the number of bits required to store
   the maximum size (alignment) of any type or object as an unsigned quantity.

   MAX_ALIGN_BYTES is obviously fixed architecturally.
   MAX_TYPE_BYTES/MAX_TYPE_BITS must be chosen such that:

   1. MAX_TYPE_BYTES * BITS_PER_BYTE can be represented in an int, and
      thus MAX_TYPE_BYTES^2 * BITS_PER_BYTE can be represented in long.
      these assumptions allow us to avoid excessive overflowing checking
      when building and manipulating types.

   2. (MAX_TYPE_BITS + MAX_ALIGN_BITS) <= 32.
      we assume this in the layout of struct operand.

   3. MAX_TYPE_BYTES is a multiple of MAX_ALIGN_BYTES. obviates overflow
      checking when adjusting a type's size to account for its alignment.

   C89 5.2.4.1 says MAX_TYPE_BYTES must be at least ~32k. C99 says ~64k. */

   (C99 raises this to 127, which is ludicrous.) we must allow at least 32
   arguments since, for our purposes, functions which return a struct take
   an additional hidden argument. round up to 63.

   for simplicity, we only enforce this limit at the point of call, which
   means we'll accept prototypes and definitions with more arguments. but
   such functions can never be called with all their arguments; if a user
   hits this limit and finds the error confusing, he deserves it. */
