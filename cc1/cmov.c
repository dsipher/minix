   the CMP is really any prior insn that sets the flags inspected.

   if the value conditionally moved into %dst is an immediate,
   it must be loaded into a temp reg first. this is simply a
   limitation of the ATOM CMOVcc insns. such a temp is marked
   not spillable [see regify0()] since spilling it is unwise,
   not to mention pointless.

   even with the possible increased (though temporary) register

/* in this pass, we try to replace simple triangle (one-legged) or diamond
   (two-legged) CFG figures with conditional moves. see oneleg0()/twoleg0()
   above for specifics.

   this pass typically runs exactly once, in the first optimization run after
   lowering. we don't want to run iteratively during register allocation, for
   two reasons:

        1. we allocate temporaries, which would be spitting in
           the face of an allocator which is trying to spill, and
        2. we probably wouldn't have new opportunities anyway.

   we run this pass on MCH code. this is a deliberate decision as it is a
   kind of architectural optimization rather than a general one. putting
   conditional moves in LIR adds baggage to the front end with little (if
   any) benefit.

   there are size violations here. ATOM doesn't have CMOVcc in all sizes
   (byte is missing). this is of little consequence, since we deliberately
   avoid fusing, our temporaries are marked not spillable, and we always
   oversize (rather than under, which is where we get into serious trouble
   with the spill code). we use 32-bit CMOVcc for all sub-int types, and
   64-bit for the others; 16-bit CMOVcc exists but has no value w/o fusing.

   we do not permit fusing of CMOVcc operations, because ATOM may read
   the source operand whether the condition is true or not; we obviously
   should not make a conditional memory read suddenly unconditional. */
