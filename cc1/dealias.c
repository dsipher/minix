/* this pass is invoked early to force load-before-use and store-after-def
   for aliased variables, shielding the optimizer from aliasing issues. we
   do this very naively, splitting the aliased variable into many tiny live
   ranges around each access (the optimizer will coalesce the accesses). we
   ignore volatile regs/symbols: these only appear in the function prologue

/* on AMD64, there are no such things as floating-point or long immediate
   operands (the only exception to the latter being for movabsq). this is
   called before lower() to load such immediates into temporaries instead.
   don't invoke constant propagation (OPT_FOLD) after this, since it will
   just reinject the constants into the operands.

   we also take the opportunity here to rewrite floating-point I_LIR_NEG
   operations as multiplication by -1.0. this may seem an odd place, but:

            (a) deconst() is not an optional pass (as OPT_NORM is)
                and lower.c can't handle floating-point I_LIR_NEG

            (b) the resulting I_LIR_MUL is an immediate candidate for
                `deconstification', and will benefit from the opt()
                pass that immediately follows (see exit_func). */
