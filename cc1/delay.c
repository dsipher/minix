/* in a basic block, we attempt to shuffle LOAD/STORE instructions
   to their earliest possible points. for LOADs in particular, the
   intent is to allow the CPU as much time as possible to fetch the
   value before we attempt to use it. STOREs can benefit, too; there
   is no reason not to tell the memory subsystem as soon as possible
   that we have something for it to do. (at least, in theory.)

   there's another benefit to this shuffling, which explains why we
   call this OPT_LIR_DELAY: it has the effect of pushing post-inc or
   post-dec ops past a memory op which uses the affected variable in
   its address calculations. by delaying the increment/decrement this
   way, it eases register pressure and avoids unnecessary copies by
   leaving the prior value available before it's modified.

   the delay optimization is nearly as old as c is, appearing in s.c.
