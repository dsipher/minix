/* we use a dag to show insn dependencies within a basic block.
   the dag is represented as a set of unique edge tuples, (i, j),
   where i and j are insn indices in the block. each tuple reads
   `i is dependent on j`. the terminology is a little misleading:
   what this means is that j must occur before i in the block.

   the tuples in deps aren't ordered at all, and we manipulate it
   using straightforward linear accesses. this is near optimal for
   almost all cases (except pathologically large basic blocks). */
