struct block;

/* per-block live variable data. DEF/USE/IN/OUT have their usual meanings.

   ranges describe live ranges within a block. the basic interpretation of
   a range is that the DEF of reg at insn index 'def' in the block is USEd
   at insn index 'use' in the block. collectively they form local du chains.
   a nonsense range where def == use is used as a placeholder for the def
   which governs a chain. the vector is ordered by (def, reg, use), so the
   placeholder entry will be first, followed immediately by all uses reached
   by the def. a placeholder by itself, with no uses, is a dead store.

   if def is INSN_INDEX_BEFORE then the reg is live-in. similarly, if use is
   INSN_INDEX_AFTER, the reg is live-out. if use is INSN_INDEX_BRANCH, then
   the block branch logic depends on reg, either directly (when a conditional
   branch depends on REG_CC) or indirectly (B_SWITCH on the control reg). */
