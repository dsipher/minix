/* per-block reaching definitions data. reaching definitions require that
   the CFG be decorated such that each DEF of a reg has a unique subscript;
   the definitions that reach a point can then be represented as a reg set.

   this has some advantages for us over more conventional representations
   (e.g. ud chains). for starters, reg sets are fast and easy to work with,
   and are used extensively throughout the compiler. more importantly, the
   representation lends itself well to the labeling of webs in the CFG for
   register allocation, which is a primary use of reaching definitions.

   one disadvantage is that we can't quickly map a DEF to the block/insn
   where it occurs: at present we have no need of that information (at
   least, not to that precision). another problem is that the reaching
   data is only useful as long as the DEFs are decorated. not all passes
   of the compiler want or understand the decorated DEFs, so decorating
   and undecorating the CFG accordingly takes time. */

/* perform reaching analysis. in the absence of flags, the end result

   if REACH_ANALYZE_WEBS is given, then the analysis is continued, and
   the maximal unions of the (effective) use-def and def-use chains are
   found to form `webs' (a.k.a. live ranges, but we use muchnick's term
   to differentiate from our struct ranges in live data). then the CFG
   is redecorated- DEFs and USEs alike- such that two regs have the same
   index and subscript iff they are part of the same web. (this final
   redecoration, perhaps ironically, invalidates block reach.in data.)
