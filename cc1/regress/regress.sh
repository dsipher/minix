# simple regression testing for the ux/64 c compiler.
# we build the compiler, tools, and library three times.
#
# 1. the stage1 compiler is built with the system compiler, then
# 2. the stage2 compiler is built with the stage1 compiler, then
# 3. the stage3 compiler is built with the stage2 compiler.
#
# we use each stageX compiler to build the test sources in
# tests/ to stageX/out/. diffs are generated between the
# stage1/stage2 and stage2/stage3 outputs. any differences
# usually indicate some kind of problem in the compiler.
#
# the test files themselves are nothing especially important,
# they are simply a collection [mostly] non-trivial c sources,
# pre-preprocessed so they have no external depedencies. many
# of them come from the compiler itself, though this is merely
# a convenience; they are not synced with the sources proper.
#
# stage1/out and stage2/out are disposable. we keep stage3/out
# in the repository so we can track changes in compiler output
# across versions of the compiler, as it (hopefully) improves.
#
# the system compiler used to build stage1 should be known good,
# or even a third-party compiler for best results. in the latter
# case, beware valid and otherwise harmless differences in the
# interpretation of the compiler sources (e.g., the order of the
# evaluation of function arguments) may cause spurious differences
# between stage1 and stage2 out.
#
# this script must be invoked inside the regress/ directory.
