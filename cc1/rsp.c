   basic block into one final addq $(X0 + X1 + .. + Xn), %rsp.
   in the old days, this was of course far more valuable, when
   the stack saw more action in argument passing.

   it's still worth doing. it's cheap and effective: nearly 10%
   of the adjustments in the regression suite are eliminated. */
