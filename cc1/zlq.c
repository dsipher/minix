/* the ATOM architecture automatically zeros bits[63:32] of a register
   when it is written to as a 32-bit operand. here we perform data-flow
   analysis to determine at which points the last write(s) to a register
   zeroed the upper bits, and use this to eliminate unnecessary MOVZLQs.

   we are not doing proper data-flow analysis here, so the result is too
   conservative. we need a real lattice to carry data around loops. fix!
   this is not trivial: we can't assume regs whose definitions we haven't
   seen are undefined, since the definitions may be outside this function.

   OPT_LIR_POS does a lot of preparatory work for us, replacing MOVSLQs
   with MOVZLQs that we try to eliminate here. such opportunities arise
   often, e.g., when iterating over an array with [signed] int index.

   this pass must run last, as we have no means of maintaining a dependency
   on the _size_ of a previous write. if we try to interleave other passes
   they might pull the rug out from underneath us. on the bright side, this
   allows us to optimize for working on the small set of machine regs. */
