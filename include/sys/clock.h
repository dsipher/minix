/* shamelessly stolen from v7. to paraphrase the comments there:

     the callout structure is for a routine arranging to be
     called by the the global clock interrupt pitisr() with
     a specified argument, after a specified amount of ticks.

   unlike v7, we maintain callouts as a linked list rather than
   a fixed array. the caller is responsible for allocating the
   callo struct's storage and loaning it to timeout() while it
   is queued. when the callo expires, the callo is unqueued and
   c_func is invoked with interrupts disabled. */
