/* the ux/64 filesystem is fairly conventional, with 4k blocks. we
   choose this value to match our page size, which simplifies the vm
   system. as a bonus, it is the native sector size of modern disks.

   block 0 is the superblock, which doubles as the boot block. this
   is followed by s_bmap_blocks of block bitmaps (0=used, 1=free),
   then `s_imap_blocks' of inode bitmaps, then `s_inode_blocks' of
   inodes. the balance of the disk comprises allocatable blocks.

   inode 0 is reserved for anonymous backing storage (aka swap).

   since inode 0 and block 0 have special fixed purposes, they can
   never be allocated, so the value 0 is often used as a sentinel
   meaning "no inode" or "no block" in on-disk structures, or as a
   return value from a function. the root inode is always inode 1. */
