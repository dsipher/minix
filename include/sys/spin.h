   `int' since the BTC insn (see locore.s) doesn't operate on char
   (XCHG doesn't seem like a good alternative on ATOM), and short
   or long would require operand-size overrides. (if this seems
   petty, it's because it is. there are not enough spinlocks in
   the kernel to split hairs over the wasted cycles or bytes.) */
