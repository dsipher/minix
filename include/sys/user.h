/* the user structure holds partial state for the current process. it is
   always found at USER_BASE (see sys/page.h) and shares USER_PAGES with
   the process's kernel stack. the remainder of the process state can be
   found in its struct proc, cross-referenced here via u_procp.

   historically, unix split the state to preserve kernel data space: the
   user struct carried the bulk state that is only referenced from within
   the context of the process itself, whereas the much smaller proc struct
   held process information needed from other contexts. we continue this
   convention, though for slightly different reasons. in particular, the
   u. area's fixed address in kernel space allows us to avoid the headache
   of per-cpu data. (e.g., u.procp answers `which process is on this cpu?')

   if you change the layout, be sure to keep in sync with U_* in locore.s. */
