/* this is a simple but fast allocator in the vein of Chris Kingsley's
   allocator (as found in 4.3BSD). we round up every request to a power
   of two, and return regions of that size (minus overhead). we never
   return memory to the system, instead keeping freed regions in buckets
   for later re-use. this works well in a virtual memory environment, for
   two reasons:

        1. we are not really allocating memory, but address space. if the
           caller requests a 520k allocation and we give them a 1GB region,
           the caller will (should) never touch the unused portion, and thus
           the VM system will never have occasion to assign real memory there.
        2. there's little need to return unused memory to the system. if an
           unused region lives in a free bucket for too long, the system will
           eventually page it to disk. disk storage is cheap, and so are the
           I/O operations (even if they are ultimately wasted).

   we allocate small objects in PAGE_SIZE slabs, since extra spaces in pages
   really WOULD get wasted. */
