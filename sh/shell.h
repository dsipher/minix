 * The follow should be set to reflect the type of system you have:
 *  TILDE -> 1 if you want the shell to expand ~logname.
 *  USEGETPW -> 1 if getpwnam() must be used to look up a name.
 *  define BSD if you are running 4.2 BSD or later.
 *  define SYSV if you are running under System V.
 *  define DEBUG=1 to compile in debugging (set global "debug" to turn on)
 *  define DEBUG=2 to compile in and turn on debugging.
 *
 * When debugging is on, debugging info will be written to $HOME/trace and
 * a quit signal will generate a core dump.
